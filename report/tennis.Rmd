Data Manipulation and Processing 

Rankings. There are three parts to rankings
First the clean data that we are working with includes the top 100 players with their ID, rank, points, date of birth, and country.
We are looking most at rank, points, and country. 

For this part we wanted to analyze a country’s depth, meaning if they have produced multiple top players, or if the country only has really one or two top players only. 

For the first part, we looked at the rankings from 2015 and created a mapping using a list, where each item of the list is a country, then its elements are the ranking of their players in the top 100. This was accomplished by manipulating our data first into a table and then into a data frame.
First we defined depth as a country with more than one player in the top 100. This means the country has more than one representative in the top 100. Then we went even more specific to look at the top 50, top20 and top10. 
We created basic bar plots to visualize these categories individually. Then we used ggplot to combine all these findings and figure our the dominant counties.

For the second part, we wanted to track the evolution of the rankings between 2010 to 2015. Based off the top 100 rankings for those years, we could count how many of players those countries had in the top 100. Then, with the different years, we can see how consistent those country’s players performed. For this we had to merge the different data frames into one so we could visualize this in one graph. Therefore, we took advantage of the table and merge functions in R. We also had to reshape our new table to be ready to use ggplot correctly.

For the third part, we use the number of points each player received for playing and winning tournaments. We can use this to determine the average number points a player in the top 100 accumulated, and then compare this average to the players from each country. This is to determine which country produces players in comparison to the average. Therefore, we can determine the top countries by the points accumulated. 



RESULTS:
Results of rankings analysis: From Part I, we can look at our graph “2015 Country Depth” and see that Spain (ESP) was the most dominant, akin the most players in the top 100, and held consistently even in with 2 players in the top 10. Also, France (FRA) had a strong showing, with 10 players in the top 100 and most players (4) in the top 20, and a tied for most players in the top 10 as well. Another thing to note is that Switzerland (SUI) has only 2 players in the top 100, but those 2 players also happen to be in the top 10! 

We can look at our other graph, “2015 Country Depth by Percentage” to see that indeed, Spain (ESP), France (FRA), and Switzerland (SUI) dominated the top 10. One interesting note is the USA dropped out of the top 10 after a solid showing in the top 100 and top 50. 

For Part II, we analyzed the movement and evolution of rankings of these countries from 2010 - 2015. We use “Evolution of Tennis Rankings” to determine the consistency of these countries. Just from looking at the graph, we can note that Spain was consistently on the top, with France a consistent second rank. After those top two, it gets a bit fuzzier. USA jumps from having 5 to 9 players in the top 100 from 2010-2015. But what is discouraging for Germany is that they are trending downwards. From 9 in the top100 in 2010, they dipped to 6 in 2012 and struggled to having no more players in the top 100 by 2015. 


From Part III, we look at our graph “Top 5 Countries by Average Points 2015” to see which are the strongest overall countries by the amount of points they accumulated in comparison to the average. Immediately we see Switzerland, Serbia, and Germany in the top three. Something interesting is that Spain is no longer a part of the top 5 countries, though previously they showed in the depth rankings. If we looked at our table, “country_vs_avg_2015_sorted” we would notice that Spain was ranked 9th in overall points.


From these rankings we can conclude that the dominant countries of tennis, from 2010 to 2015 are, in no particular order: Spain, France, Switzerland, and Serbia. These findings do make sense if we look at the individual players. For Spain, players like Rafael Nadal, 
Feliciano Lopez, and Roberto Bautista Agut help bolster their rankings. For France, Fichard Hasquet, Jo Wilfried Tsonga, Gilles Simon, Benoit  Paire, among others help their strong showing at the top. Switzerland boasts two of the top 5 players in Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka, but apart from those two, Switzerland doesn’t have much of a showing. Finally, Novak Djokovic, the current World Number 1, has bolstered Serbia’s rankings mostly by himself, with fellow countryman Viktor Troicki also in the top 50.
