## Organization of Directories

We have a "raw_data" directory which downloads the raw information we need from an online repository. Note we don't need a "resources" directory since we are downloading directly from "raw_data" directory.
We have a "clean_data" directory which parses and cleans the data in which we can directly use, in a csv format.
We have a "code" directory which is where we do our analysis. We are using RMarkdown instead of R script for this portion of the project because we wanted to be able to annotate our processes neatly as well as be able to use its interactive functions. 
We have an "images" directory which saves all the plots and images generated from our code.
Finally, we have our "report" directory which stores our written analysis of our project. This is done in RMarkdown and includes an Introduction, Data Extraction and Cleaning, Data Manipulation and Processing, Results, and Conclusion. We have included some code for our plots and graphs in this writeup.

Note: There is also a directory called "TennisAnalysis." This was created as a GitHub repository. This is the link: https://github.com/william0cheung/TennisAnalysis
