## Organization of Directories

We have a "raw_data" directory which downloads the raw information we need from an online repository. Note we don't need a "resources" directory since we are downloading directly from "raw_data" directory.
We have a "clean_data" directory which parses and cleans the data in which we can directly use, in a csv format.
We have a "code" directory which is where we do our analysis in R.
We have an "images" directory which saves all the plots and images generated from our code.
Finally, we have our "report" directory which stores our written analysis of our project.

Note: There is also a directory called "TennisAnalysis." This was created as a GitHub repository. This is the link: https://github.com/william0cheung/TennisAnalysis
